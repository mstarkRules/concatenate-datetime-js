# concatenate-datetime-js
This project teaches how to concatenate two date objects into one.
We created a few static files, with html and js. Our index page:
- displays a form
- displays date and time selection components
- catches their payload when submiting them
- extracts the date from the first param
- extracts the time from the second param
- concatenates both in a variable

This solution is usefull not only when using date and time selection in a form, but also when we want to extract date and time from different date objects and turn them into one
